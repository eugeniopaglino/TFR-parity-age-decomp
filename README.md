# TFR-parity-age-decomp

R code to decompose difference in Total Fertility Rates into age- and parity-specific components using general decomposition techniques.

The code sets up the decomposition with data for Sweden, comparing TFR in 2000 and 2015, from the Human Fertility Database. However, the code is easily adjustable to replicate the analysis for different countries and calendar years. In addition, the main function to compute TFR from age- and parity-specific fertility rates is written flexibly enough to handle different formats.
